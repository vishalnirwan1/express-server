FEATURES OF VISUAL STUDIO CODE

1. Intellisense
IntelliSense is code auto-complete feature. These is derived from several contextual factors such as the programming language, the syntax, the variables, the functions as well as all the codes within the file.

2. Peek
While coding, you may often forget a particular function, where the function is initially defined, and what are the required parameters.
With Peek, you can select a function then hit Shift + F12. The selection expands into an inline window showing the complete definition of the function as well as where the function is defined. 

3. Built-in Git
